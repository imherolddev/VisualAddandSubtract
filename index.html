<p>This app will feature a way for the user to enter a simple addition, or subtraction equation, and have groups of circles drawn to the screen to visualize the equation. Once the circles are drawn, the user can interact with the circles to alter the size of the groups.</p>

<p>-Example (this mornings revelation with my son):
Users equation: 8+8
User moves 2 circles from one group to the other, yielding: 10+6</p>

<p>Possibilities:
-Limit maximum number of circles based on screen size, for best usability
-After use enters equation append equals sign and check answer. Visual affirmation of equations solution
-Alternative: if user simply enters a number, they may move circles into a separate group, need to designate addition or subtraction. Append equals sign and check equation. Visual affirmation of equation.</p>

<p>This project will be open source, however, I will be releasing it under my developer account for free. All contributors will be credited, and I will link your developer account in the Play Store listing. This will help avoid confusion and maintain order. However, being open source, you are more than welcome to fork the project, make your own revisions and release it how you would like.</p>
